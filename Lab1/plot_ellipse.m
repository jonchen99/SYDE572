% Plot_Ellipse(x,y,theta,a,b)
%
% This routine plots an ellipse with centre (x,y), axis lengths a,b
% with major axis at an angle of theta radians from the horizontal.
%
% *** Note: many students had a LOT of trouble with this.
%           I suggest you take a little time to look at this routine
%           to see how it works.  It's only four lines of code, but
%           some people spent hours trying to write something like
%           this themselves last year.
